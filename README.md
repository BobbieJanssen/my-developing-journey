# my-developing-journey
I'm working on The Odin Project and rather than making a recipe website I decided to make a blog. This way I can also track my journey and log what I learned, etc. Being able to explain what I've learned is really valuable. Until now, I've been talking to my coffee cup, so trying another approach.
